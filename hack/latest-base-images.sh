# This script fetches the latest sha256 digest of each base image for each architecture we support on servers
# and writes those hashes to Makefile-formatted variables for use in Makefiles.

# This in turn allows us to easily update all base images to their latest versions, while mantaining the use
# of digests rather than tags when we refer to these base images.
