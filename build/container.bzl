# multi_arch_container produces a private internal container_image, multiple
# arch-specific tagged container_bundles (named NAME-ARCH), an alias
# from NAME to the appropriately NAME-ARCH container_bundle target, and a
# genrule for NAME.tar copying the appropriate NAME-ARCH container bundle
# tarball output for the currently-configured architecture.
# Additionally, if docker_push_tags is provided, uses multi_arch_container_push
# to create container_bundles named push-NAME-ARCH with the provided push tags,
# along with a push-NAME docker_push target.
# Args:
#   name: name used for the alias; the internal container_image and
#     container_bundles are based on this name
#   architectures: list of architectures (in GOARCH naming parlance) to
#     configure
#   base: base image to use for the containers. The format string {ARCH} will
#     be replaced with the configured GOARCH.
#   docker_tags: list of docker tags to apply to the image. The format string
#     {ARCH} will be replaced with the configured GOARCH; any stamping variables
#     should be escaped, e.g. {{STABLE_MY_VAR}}.
#   docker_push_tags: list of docker tags to apply to the image for pushing.
#     The format string {ARCH} will be replaced with the configured GOARCH;
#     any stamping variables should be escaped, e.g. {{STABLE_MY_VAR}}.
#   tags: will be applied to all targets
#   visiblity: will be applied only to the container_bundles; the internal
#     container_image is private
#   All other args will be applied to the internal container_image.
