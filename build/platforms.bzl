## NOTE: We (cert-manager) do not currently build for multiple platforms, so
## most of this functionality is not utilised. It is kept in case we do end out
## publishing binaries for different 'platform categories' in future.
#
# for_platforms returns a dictionary to be used with select().
# select() is used for configurable attributes (most attributes, notably
# excluding output filenames), and takes a dictionary mapping a condition
# to a value for that attribute.
# select() is described in more detail in the Bazel documentation:
# https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/functions.html#select
#
# One notable condition is the target platform (os and arch).
# Kubernetes binaries generally target particular platform categories,
# such as client binaries like kubectl, or node binaries like kubelet.
# Additionally, some build artifacts need specific configurations such as
# the appropriate arch-specific base image.
#
# This macro produces a dictionary where each of the platform categories
# (client, node, server, test, all) is enumerated and filled in
# with the provided arguments as the values.
#
# For example, a filegroup might want to include one binary for all client
# platforms and another binary for server platforms. The client and server
# platform lists have some shared items but also some disjoint items.
# The client binary can be provided in for_client and the server binary provided
# in for_server; this macro will then return a select() dictionary that
# includes the appropriate binaries based on the configured platform.
#
# Another example selecting the appropriate base image for a docker container.
# One can use select(for_platforms(for_server="base-image-{ARCH}//image"))
# to have the appropriate arch-specific image selected.
#
# The for_platform arguments can be lists, dictionaries, or strings, but
# they should all be the same type for a given call.
# The tokens {OS} and {ARCH} will be substituted with the corresponding values,
# but if a dictionary is provided, only the dictionary values will be formatted.
#
# If default is provided, a default condition will be added with the provided
# value.
# only_os can be used to select a single OS from a platform category that lists
# multiple OSes. For example, it doesn't make sense to build debs or RPMs for
# anything besides Linux, so you might supply only_os="linux" for those rules.
#
# For a complete example, consult something like the release-tars target in
# build/release-tars/BUILD.
