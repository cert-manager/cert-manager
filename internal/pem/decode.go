// The constants below are estimates at reasonable upper bounds for sizes of PEM data that cert-manager might encounter.
// cert-manager supports RSA, ECDSA and Ed25519 keys, of which RSA keys are by far the largest.

// We'll aim to support RSA certs / keys which are larger than the maximum size (defined in pkg/util/pki.MaxRSAKeySize).

// RSA keys grow proportional to the size of the RSA key used. For example:
// PEM-encoded RSA Keys: 4096-bit is ~3kB, 8192-bit is ~6kB and a 16k-bit key is ~12kB.

// Certificates have two variables that we can estimate easily; the public key of the cert, and the signature from the signing cert.
// An N-bit key produces an (N/8)-byte signature, so as a worst case for us, a 16kB RSA key will create a 2kB signature.

// PEM-encoded RSA X.509 certificates:
// Signed with  1k-bit RSA key: 4096-bit is ~1.4kB, 8192-bit is ~2kB, 16k-bit is ~3.5kB
// Signed with 16k-bit RSA key: 4096-bit is ~3.3kB, 8192-bit is ~4kB, 16k-bit is ~5.4kB

// See https://fm4dd.com/openssl/certexamples.shtm for examples of large RSA certs / keys
