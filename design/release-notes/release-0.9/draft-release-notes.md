The v0.9 release is one of our biggest yet, packed with new features and bug
fixes!

The introduction of the new CertificateRequest resource type is significant as
it is a step towards where we want to be for 1.0, defining an API specification
for Certificates and allowing anyone to implement their own issuers and CAs as
first class citizens.

## Notable Items

### New CertificateRequest Resource

A new resource has been introduced - `CertificateRequest` - that is used to
request certificates using a raw x509 certificate signing request. This resource
is not typically used by humans but rather by other controllers or services. For
example, the `Certificate` controller will now create a `CertificateRequest`
resource to resolve its own Spec.

Controllers to resolve `CertificateRequest`s are currently disabled by default
and enabled via the feature gate `CertificateRequestControllers`. This feature
is currently in Alpha and only the CA issuer has been implemented.

This resource is going to enable out of tree, external issuer controllers to
resolve requests. Other issuer implementations and details on how to develop an
out of tree issuer will follow in later releases. You can read more on the
motivations and road map in the [enhancement
proposal](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/blob/master/design/20190708.certificate-request-crd.md)
or how this resource is used in the
[docs](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/release-0.9/reference/certificaterequests.html).


### DNS Zones support for ACME challenge solver selector

A list of DNS zones can now be added to the ACME challenge solver selector.  The
most specific DNS zone match specified here will take precedence over other DNS
zone matches, so a solver specifying `sys.example.com` will be selected over one
specifying `example.com` for the domain `www.sys.example.com`. If multiple
solvers match with the same dnsZones value, the solver with the most matching
labels in matchLabels will be selected. If neither has more matches, the solver
defined earlier in the list will be selected.

### Certificate Readiness Prometheus Metrics

Cert-manager now exposes Prometheus metrics on Certificate ready statuses as
`certmanager_certificate_ready_status`. This is useful for monitoring
Certificate resources to ensure they have a `Ready=True` status.

### Prometheus Operator ServiceMonitor

Support has been added to include a Prometheus ServiceMonitor for cert-manager
in the helm chart. This enables monitoring of cert-manager when in conjunction
with the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/coreos/prometheus-operator).
This is disabled by default but can be enabled via the helm configuration.

### ACMEv2 POST-as-GET

We have now switched to use the new POST-as-GET feature that was introduced
into the latest version of the ACME spec a few months ago.

If you are running your own ACME server, please ensure it supports POST-as-GET
as we no longer supported the old behaviour.

### ACME Issuer Solver Pod Template

The ACME Solver Pod Spec now exposes a template that can be used to change
metadata about that pod. Currently, a template will expose labels, annotations,
node selector, tolerations, and affinity. This is useful when running
cert-manager in multi-arch clusters, or when you run workloads across different
types of nodes and need to restrict where the acmesolver pod runs.

## Action Required

### Length limit for Common Names

Common names with a character length of over 63 will be rejected during
validation. This is due to the upper limit being detailed in RFC 5280.

### Distroless Cert-Manager Base Images

For each container, cert-manager ships with the base image
'gcr.io/distroless/static' which is a minimal image that includes no binaries.
Users who want to debug from within the cert-manager pod will need to attach an
additional container with their debug utilities to the pod's namespace.

### CSRs in Order Resources now PEM Encoded

CSRs in Order resources have previously been incorrectly DER encoded due to an
error in implementation. This has now been corrected to PEM encoding. Current
orders that were created with a previous version of cert-manager will fail to
validate and so will be recreated. This should resume the order normally.
