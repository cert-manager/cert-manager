## Summary

This proposal introduces a mechanism to specify a future `NotBefore` time in cert-manager certificates, enabling delayed activation of issued certificates.

## Motivation

Currently, cert-manager creates the Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with `NotBefore` set to the current time (`time.Now()`).  This prevents use cases where a certificate needs to be issued in advance but only become valid at a specific future time. For example,

- **Pre-provisioning Certificates:** Generating certificates for resources that will be deployed in the future, such as for a scheduled application rollout.
- **Compliance Requirements:** Adhering to specific security policies that mandate a future validation start date for certificates.

Supporting a future `NotBefore` time aligns with the capabilities of x509.CertificateRequest and provides greater flexibility in certificate management.

### Goals

- Extend the `Certificate` and `CertificateRequest` APIs to allow specifying a future `NotBefore` time.
- Update the `CertificateRequest` controller to honor the specified NotBefore time when creating x509.CertificateRequests.
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing certificate issuance workflows.

### Non-Goals

- This proposal does not aim to change the behavior of existing certificates without a `NotBefore` field.

## Proposal

Introduce a new optional field, `NotBefore`, to the spec of both `Certificate` and `CertificateRequest` resources. This field will allow users to explicitly define the start time of the certificate's validity period.

### API changes

```
type CertificateSpec struct {
  // EXISTING FIELDS
  // ...

  // NotBefore defines the time when the certificate becomes valid.
  // If omitted or set to a time in the past, the certificate will be 
  // valid immediately upon issuance.
  // +optional
  NotBefore *metav1.Time `json:"notBefore,omitempty"`
}

type CertificateRequestSpec struct {
  // EXISTING FIELDS
  // ...

  // NotBefore defines the time when the certificate becomes valid.
  // If omitted or set to a time in the past, the certificate will be 
  // valid immediately upon issuance.
  // +optional
  NotBefore *metav1.Time `json:"notBefore,omitempty"` 
}
```

### Examples

#### Issuance with Future NotBefore

```
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: example-cert
spec:
  secretName: example-cert-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-prod
    kind: ClusterIssuer
  commonName: example.com
  notBefore: "2024-10-01T10:00:00Z" 
  duration: 2160h # 90 days
```

This example creates a certificate that will only become valid on October 1st, 2024, even if it is issued earlier.

#### Renewal with NotBefore

During renewal, cert-manager will use the `NotBefore` value from the `Certificate` or `CertificateRequest` CR if it's still in the future. Otherwise, the renewed certificate will be issued with immediate validity.

### Implementation Considerations

**Defaults:** If `NotBefore` is omitted or set to a time in the past (this can happen during renewal), the current time should be used.

### Backward Compatibilty

This proposal maintains backward compatibility. Existing `Certificate` and `CertificateRequest` resources without the new field will continue to function as they currently do, with `NotBefore` defaulting to the current time.

### Test Plan

**Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests will be added to cover different `NotBefore` values, including nil, past, and future times.
**Integration Tests:** End-to-end tests will be added to verify the complete certificate issuance flow with various `NotBefore` values.

### Upgrading

As this is an optional field, upgrading to a cert-manager version with this new field or downgrading to one without it should not require extra steps or cause unnecessary re-issuances.

### Misc

The cert-manager documentation will be updated to include details about this feature, usage with examples.

## Alternatives

Instead of adding a new field to the `Certificate` and `CertificateRequest` API, an annotation could be used to define `NotBefore`. However, using a dedicated field in the spec provides better visibility, type safety, and integration with cert-manager's validation and processing logic.
