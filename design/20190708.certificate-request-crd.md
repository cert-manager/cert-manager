## Summary

Currently, certificates issued via cert-manager rely on the `Certificate`
resource being reconciled by the `Certificate` controller. This resource imposes
limitations on what issuers are able to honour the `Certificate` resource as
well as other opinionated implementation details.

This proposal adds a new custom resource `CertificateRequest` that contains an
x509 certificate signing request, a target issuer, and other metadata about the
request. Each issuer will have their own `CertificateRequest` controller to
watch for resources that are referencing them. The `Certificate` controller will
then rely on creating `CertificateRequest`s to resolve its own Spec.

## Motivation

Currently the required use of the `Certificate` resource means that users are
forced to:

- expose the signed certificate's private key to the API server
- be limited to the finite set of issuers as implemented into the cert-manager
  project, or, "in-tree"
- adhere to the `Certificate` controller's opinionated implementation, limiting
  scope for integrations with other projects
- rely on developers of the cert-manager project for reviews and approval of new
  issuers

Due to these issues, cert-manager can be often unsuitable for some use
cases/integrations or users are unsatisfied with some behaviour. Lack of
exposure of options that a raw x509 certificate signing request provides can
also be a source of frustration.

With cert-manger maintainers ensuring that all issuers are always fully
supported and tested, it becomes difficult for new issuers to become
accepted. Some developers of new issuers would be happy to maintain these
issuers themselves however is not possible with all issuers belonging in the
same code base and repository.

### Goals

- Introduce the `CertificateRequest` resource.
- Create a `CertificateRequest` controller for each in-tree issuer to resolve
  `CertificateRequest`.
- Change the implementation of the `Certificate` controller to rely on the
  `CertificateRequest` resource to resolve the request.
- Update documentation detailing this new behaviour and how it can be used to
  develop out-of-tree implantations of an issuer `CertificateRequest`
  controller.
- Create a boilerplate/scaffolding example code to help quick start developers
  on creating a controller with best practices.

### Non-Goals

- This proposal does not document or explore possible or planned integrations
  using this new functionality.
- This proposal will not investigate possible alignment or merging with the
  Kubernetes internal `CertificateSigningRequest` resource. Although is is of
  interest, the motivation is mostly in order to get a built-in approval workflow
  for CertificateRequests. The feasibility of being able to implement a solution
  using the built-in type in the near future however is small, so we'd rather
  'trail-blaze' here and then try and fold our changes back upstream at a later
  date.

## Proposal

### API Changes

This proposal will create the following new API types in the
`certmanager.k8s.io` group;

```
// CertificateRequestSpec defines the desired state of CertificateRequest
type CertificateRequestSpec struct {
	// Requested certificate default Duration
	// +optional
	Duration *metav1.Duration `json:"duration,omitempty"`

	// IssuerRef is a reference to the issuer for this CertificateRequest.  If
	// the 'kind' field is not set, or set to 'Issuer', an Issuer resource with
	// the given name in the same namespace as the CertificateRequest will be
	// used.  If the 'kind' field is set to 'ClusterIssuer', a ClusterIssuer with
	// the provided name will be used. The 'name' field in this stanza is
	// required at all times. The group field refers to the API group of the
	// issuer which defaults to 'certmanager.k8s.io' if empty.
	IssuerRef ObjectReference `json:"issuerRef"`

	// Byte slice containing the PEM encoded CertificateSigningRequest
	// +optional
	CSRPEM []byte `json:"csr,omitempty"`

	// IsCA will mark the resulting certificate as valid for signing. This
	// implies that the 'signing' usage is set
	// +optional
	IsCA bool `json:"isCA,omitempty"`
}

// CertificateStatus defines the observed state of CertificateRequest and
// resulting signed certificate.
type CertificateRequestStatus struct {
	// +optional
	Conditions []CertificateRequestCondition `json:"conditions,omitempty"`

	// Byte slice containing a PEM encoded signed certificate resulting from the
	// given certificate signing request.
	// +optional
	Certificate []byte `json:"certificate,omitempty"`

	// Byte slice containing the PEM encoded certificate authority of the signed
	// certificate.
	// +optional
	CA []byte `json:"ca,omitempty"`
}
```

The `CertificateRequestCondition` resembles much the same of the
`CertificateRequestCondition`.

The `ObjectReference` field type has had a new field `Group` added as follows:

```
// ObjectReference is a reference to an object with a given name, kind and group.
type ObjectReference struct {
	Name string `json:"name"`
	// +optional
	Kind string `json:"kind,omitempty"`
	// +optional
	Group string `json:"group,omitempty"`
}
```

The group refers to the API group that the target Issuer belongs to. This
enables namespacing of references to different issuers of external API groups.

### Controller Behaviour

The philosophy for the `CertificateRequest` controllers are planned to be as
minimal as possible in that the single goal of them is to enable its owning
`Issuer` to create the resulting certificate. Once a sync on a
`CertificateRequest` has been observed, the general flow is as follows:

- Check the group belongs to the owning `Issuer`, exit if not.
- Check if `CertificateRequest` is in a failed state, exit if true. TODO: more
  tightly define what a 'failed state' exactly is.
- Check the `Issuer` type is of the same type, exit if not.
- Verify the Spec of the `CertificateRequest`.
- If a certificate exits then update the status if needed and exit.
- Sign the certificate via the Issuer using the contents of Spec.

It is worth noting that whether the certificate is invalid, out-of-date or
failed then the controller should take no further action on the resource. It is
the responsibility of a higher level controller such as the `Certificate`
controller to take further action to retry the certificate issuance through
managing the life cycle of the `CertificateRequest` resources.

With all `Issuer`s updated with `CertificateRequest` controllers, the
`Certificate` controller will be migrated to begin to use and manage the life
cycle `CertificateRequest`s to resolve it's Spec. Further concrete
implementation details TBD.

### Internal API Resource Behaviour

The group name of `IssuerRef` inside `CertificateRequest`s is to be defaulted
to "certmanager.k8s.io" if the field is empty, using a mutating webhook. This
means that if unspecified, `CertificateRequest` objects will be put into the
ownership of the default pool of issuers in the cert-manager project.

Until the mutating webhook is fully implemented, we will handle defaulting
internally in the controller.

### Test Plan

Standard unit and end-to-end tests will be used to verify new behaviour, as used
by cert-manager currently. Current end-to-end tests for `Certificate` resources
will also give a good signal for `CertificateRequest`s once the controller has
migrated its implementation.

### Risks and Mitigations

The introduction and consequently the reliance on this core resource for all
cert-manager functions means it poses a high risk to bugs or unexpected behaviour
appearing across the whole codebase. With this, it is key to ensure the change
happens in incremental roll-outs and proper care is taken during testing.

The new resource could be potentially confusing for current cert-manager
users. To mitigate this, proper documentation should be created to explain the
changes. It should also be made clear that the resource is typically only to be
consumed or managed by a more complex controller or system, not necessarily a
human user.

### Graduation Criteria

##### Alpha

- Creation of `CertificateRequest` resource.
- A CA issuer `CertificateRequest` controller.
- Exposing the single controller via a feature gated flag.

##### Alpha -> Beta Graduation

- All issuers have a `CertificateRequest` controller.
- All controllers are enabled by default.
- The `Certificate` controller optionally makes use of the `CertificateRequest`
  resource to resolve certificates when a feature flag is enabled.

##### Beta -> GA Graduation

- The `CertificateRequest` API resource should be considered stable.
- The `Certificate` controller makes use of the `CertificateRequest` resource to
  resolve certificates.

##### Removing a deprecated flag
