## Summary

This proposal outlines the addition of ListenerSet support in cert-manager, enabling application developers to configure TLS settings independently of cluster operators within Gateway API. This capability addresses a limitation where developers transitioning from Ingress to Gateway API lose control over TLS configuration. This problem has been raised by the community in [cert-manager#7473][].

[cert-manager#7473]: https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/7473

ListenerSet was introduced in [GEP-1713](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/geps/gep-1713/) and is currently only available using the `X` (experimental) versions of the Gateway API CRDs.

## Motivation

Application developers previously using Ingress could configure both routing and TLS certificates independently. With Gateway API, TLS configuration is centralized in the Gateway resource, typically controlled by the cluster operator. This change restricts developers, who must coordinate closely with cluster operators. ListenerSet provides a mechanism allowing developers to manage TLS configurations, restoring self-service capabilities akin to Ingress.

The following diagram illustrates the fact that developers must now coordinate with cluster operrators to configure the `tls` block (in green):

### Goals

- Enable application developers to independently configure TLS certificates with Gateway API using ListenerSet.
- Maintain the separation of concerns between platform admins (Gateway resource) and developers (ListenerSet and HTTPRoute resources).
- Provide flexible issuer configuration per hostname or ListenerSet, allowing multiple issuers per Gateway.

### Non-Goals

- Modifying core Gateway API behavior beyond integration with cert-manager.
- Implementing features unrelated to cert-manager annotations or TLS certificate management.

## Proposal

Add support for ListenerSet resources within cert-manager, allowing TLS certificate annotations to be placed directly on ListenerSets rather than exclusively on Gateway objects. This will enable self-service TLS configuration by developers without compromising infrastructure control by operators.

### User Stories

#### Story 1

As a platform admin, I worry about ingress-nginx's Ingress support being EOL ([https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/7822](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/issues/7822)) and I need to be able to use `ingress2gateway` to migrate from ingress-nginx + Ingress to InGate's Gateway API implementation. An example of such migration is given [in appendix](#example-using-ingress2gateway).

#### Story 2

As an application developer, I want to configure TLS certificates independently without coordinating with the platform admin, enabling rapid deployment. 

To illustrate this, the following diagram shows that developers will be able to configure TLS by creating ListenerSet objects themselves:

![gateway-listenerset-manifests.excalidraw-fs8](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1PRYpKZgl.png)

### Notes, Constraints, and Caveats

- Adding this feature would first require us to support Gateway API's `X`
  versions of the API (just XListenerSet for now, since XGateway and XHTTPRoute
  don't exist yet).
- Annotation precedence (ListenerSet vs. Gateway) must be clearly defined.

### Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: Confusion over issuer annotation priority between Gateway and ListenerSet.

  - **Mitigation**: Document clear precedence rules (ListenerSet annotations override Gateway annotations).

- **Risk**: Increased complexity for cert-manager due to additional API surface.

  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and clear documentation.

## Design Details

### Feature Flag

The first step is to add support for `X` resource in cert-manager through a new
feature flag:

```
--feature-gates XGatewayAPI=true
```

The second is to support ListenerSet objects and their annotations by extending
cert-manager’s internal logic to process ListenerSet resources similarly to
Gateway annotations. ListenerSet annotations will override Gateway annotations
if present.

To use the feature, users will have to pass:

```
--enable-gateway-api --feature-gates XGatewayAPI=true
```

### Issuer Annotations

What about a Gateway resource with the `cert-manager.io/issuer` and a listener
set with the `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` annotation?

- If the Gateway object already has the issuer annotation, the ListenerSets
  attached to it may omit the issuer annotation: the Gateway's annotation acts
  as a default for any ListenerSet attached to it.
- If the Gateway object already has an issuer annotation, a given ListenerSet
  can override the Gateway's annotation by specifying its own
  `cert-manager.io/issuer` or `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` annotation.
- Even if a Gateway doesn't have any default issuer annotation, a ListenerSet
  can still specify its own `cert-manager.io/issuer` or
  `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer` annotation.
- The Gateway's issuer annotation is always used to populate the secret in the
  Gateway's `certificateRefs`.

### Test Plan

- Unit tests to validate ListenerSet annotation handling.
- Integration tests to ensure proper interaction with Gateway and ListenerSet
  resources.
- End-to-end tests simulating realistic deployment scenarios using InGate's
  Gateway API implementation.

### Graduation Criteria

**Alpha:**

- Implement feature behind a feature flag.
- Clearly define supported Kubernetes and Gateway API versions.
- All CI tests passing.

**Beta:**

- Feature flag is turned on by default.

### Upgrade and Downgrade Strategy

- Feature flag to control activation.
- Safe rollback by disabling feature flag if issues arise.

### Supported Versions

- Kubernetes 1.27+
- Gateway API version supporting ListenerSet (experimental, v1alpha1 initially)

## Production Readiness

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| How can this feature be enabled or disabled for an existing cert-manager installation? | Feature gate `--feature-gates XGatewayAPI=true` will control enabling/disabling reconciling `XListenerSet` resources. |
| Does this feature depend on any specific services running in the cluster? | Requires the "X" (experimental) version of Gateway API CRDs. |
| Will using this feature result in new API calls? | N/A |
| Will using this feature result in increasing size or count of existing API objects? | No. |
| Will using this feature result in significant increase of resource usage? | No. |

## Drawbacks

- Adds complexity to cert-manager’s Gateway integration.
- Potential confusion around annotation precedence.

## Alternatives

### Alternative 0: Devs and Ops coordination

You can already do that today: the developer creates an HTTPRoute, and then asks
the Platform team to add a new entry under `listeners` on the Gateway
resource. This solution isn't practical.

### Alternative 1: Let Devs edit Gateways

Another approach would be to relax the RBAC to let developers create the
listener for their HTTPRoute themselves. This solution goes against the design
goals of Gateway API.

Some Gateway API implementations such as envoy-gateway make it possible since Gateways don't need to be shared. 

But for most other implementations (such as Google's GKE Gateway controller) represent actual infra that cost money (IPs, Google Cloud Load Balancers...); these are shared across teams and are owned by cluster operators: devs can't edit Gateway objects.


### Alternative 2: Catch-all hostname + multiple certificates attached to the Gateway resource

The idea would be to have a single "catch all" listener. Each HTTPRoute would add its own entries to the `certificateRefs`:

```yaml
kind: Gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: nginx
  listeners:
    - hostname: "" # Catch-all
      name: catch-all-listener
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
      tls:
        certificateRefs:
          - name: route-1-tls
          - name: route-2-tls
          - name: route-3-tls
```

This approach wasn't pursued because "Core" Gateway API only supports a single
entry in `certificateRefs`. This limitation stems from the fact that Gateway API's
authors aim to have as much configuration as possible structured and explicit (i.e., in API fields
rather than in undocumented annotations or, even worse, embedded in annotations as JSON blobs).
Having multiple certificates under `certificateRefs` defeats this goal since implementations
would have to parse each cert to know what certificate should be handed to the client, rather
than just having to look at the Gateway object.

This alternative has also been proposed in [20230601.gateway-route-hostnames.md](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/blob/master/design/20230601.gateway-route-hostnames.md) with the idea of avoiding the duplication of hostnames that are both present in Gateway and HTTPRoute objects.

### Alternative 3: Dynamic creation of `listener` entries on the Gateway resource

Similarly to the alternative 1, we could imagine letting cert-manager create 443 listeners dynamically, e.g.:

```yaml
kind: Gateway
spec:
  gatewayClassName: nginx
  listeners:
    - name: route-1-1
      hostname: foo.com
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
      tls: { certificateRefs: [{ name: route-1-1-tls }] }
    - name: route-2-1
      hostname: bar.com
      port: 443
      protocol: HTTPS
      tls: { certificateRefs: [{ name: route-2-1-tls }] }
```

## Appendix

### Example of migration using `ingress2gateway`

Let's look at an example of Ingress resource, developers are able to manage both the HTTP and TLS side of things, including configuring cert-manager:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  name: foo
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: foo.com
      http:
        paths:
          - pathType: Prefix
            path: /
            backend:
              service:
                name: ping
                port:
                  number: 80
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - foo.com
      secretName: foo-tls
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt-prod
  name: bar
  namespace: default
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
    - host: bar.com
      http:
        paths:
          - pathType: Prefix
            path: /
            backend:
              service:
                name: ping
                port:
                  number: 80
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - bar.com
      secretName: bar-tls
```

When moving to Gateway and HTTPRoute objects, developers can no longer manage the TLS and cert-manager configuration as they can only create and edit HTTPRoutes.

      matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /
```

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
