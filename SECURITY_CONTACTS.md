# Security Contacts

This file lists people who (should) have access to read security reports
made via the cert-manager vulnerability reporting process.

If you think you've found a security issue in cert-manager, don't reach
out to any of these people individually - follow the details in
SECURITY.md and report your vulnerability via e-mail.
