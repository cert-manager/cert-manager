# cert-manager

cert-manager is a Kubernetes add-on to automate the management and issuance of
TLS certificates from various issuing sources.

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt
to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.

It is loosely based upon the work of [kube-lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego)
and has borrowed some wisdom from other similar projects e.g.
[kube-cert-manager](https://github.com/PalmStoneGames/kube-cert-manager).
