# cert-manager


cert-manager is a Kubernetes add-on to automate the management and issuance of
TLS certificates from various issuing sources.

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt
to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.

It is loosely based upon the work of [kube-lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego)
and has borrowed some wisdom from other similar projects e.g.
[kube-cert-manager](https://github.com/PalmStoneGames/kube-cert-manager).

## Current status

As this project is pre-1.0, we do not currently offer strong guarantees around our
API stability.

Notably, we may choose to make breaking changes to our API specification (i.e. the
Issuer, ClusterIssuer and Certificate resources) in new minor releases.

These will always be clearly documented in the [upgrade section of the documentation](https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/upgrading/index.html)
