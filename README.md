# cert-manager [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jetstack-experimental/cert-manager.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jetstack-experimental/cert-manager)

cert-manager is a Kubernetes addon to automate the management and issuance of
TLS certificates from various issuing sources.

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt
to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.

It is loosely based upon the work of [kube-lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego)
and has borrowed some wisdom from other similar projects e.g.
[kube-cert-manager](https://github.com/PalmStoneGames/kube-cert-manager).

## Current status

This project is still heavily under development and is not ready for use
**yet**. However, if you want to experiment, please do try running the current
development build and reporting any issues you run into.

**NOTE:** currently we provide no guarantees on our API stability. This means
there may be breaking changes that will require changes to *all* Issuer/Certificate
resources you have already created. A stable API will be cut and maintained once the
initial phase of development is complete.

## Quickstart

> Prebuilt images for cert-manager are made available on Dockerhub.

This guide sets up cert-manager to run as a Deployment on your Kubernetes
cluster.
It will then go on to set up the [Let's Encrypt ACME staging server](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/)
as a Certificate issuer, and request a Certificate for a domain you control
using both the HTTP01 and DNS01 challenge mechanisms.

By default, it will be configured to fulfil Certificate resources in all
namespaces.

### 0. Pre-requisites

* Kubernetes cluster with CustomResourceDefinitions or ThirdPartyResource
support

cert-manager uses custom resources/third party resources to represent
Certificates and Issuers. In order for cert-manager to do this, we must
register our custom API types with the Kubernetes API server. How we do this
varies slightly from Kubernetes 1.7 onwards:

#### Kubernetes 1.7 and later

Kubernetes 1.7 introduced [CustomResourceDefinitions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/).
A pre-made CRD for cert-manager is in `docs/crd.yaml`. We can install it with:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack-experimental/cert-manager/master/docs/crd.yaml
```

#### Kubernetes 1.6 and below

As Kubernetes 1.6 does not support CustomResourceDefinitions, we must instead
use ThirdPartyResources, the older, now deprecated version of
CustomResourceDefinition. A pre-made TPR for cert-manager is in
`docs/tpr.yaml`. We can install it with:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack-experimental/cert-manager/master/docs/tpr.yaml
```

### 1. Deploy cert-manager

To deploy the latest version of cert-manager, run:

```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack-experimental/cert-manager/master/docs/cert-manager.yaml
```

To deploy RBAC roles, run:
```
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jetstack-experimental/cert-manager/master/docs/rbac.yaml
```

**NOTE**

* In future this may be replaced with a Helm chart.

### 2. Set up letsencrypt staging issuer

An Issuer in cert-manager describes a source for signed TLS certificates that
cert-manager can use to fulfil Certificate resources in a Kubernetes cluster.

Within the Issuer's spec, we can define any configuration that may be required
(e.g. credentials for updating a DNS server) on a per-issuer basis.

In the below example, you **must** remember to fill in the `spec.acme.email`
field.

```yaml
apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
spec:
  acme:
    # The ACME server URL
    server: https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # Email address used for ACME registration
    email: ""
    # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key
    privateKey: letsencrypt-staging
    # ACME dns-01 provider configurations
    dns-01:
      # Here we define a list of DNS-01 providers that can solve DNS challenges
      providers:
      # We define a provider named 'prod-dns', with configuration for the
      # clouddns challenge provider.
      - name: prod-dns
        clouddns:
          # A secretKeyRef to a the google cloud json service account
          serviceAccount:
            name: clouddns-service-account
            key: service-account.json
          # The project in which to update the DNS zone
          project: gcloud-prod-project
```

This is an example Issuer for the letsencrypt staging server. Here, we define
one DNS provider, named clouddns, that can be used to solve ACME challenges.

HTTP-01 is also supported without additional configuration when using the ACME
issuer.

Upon creation of the Issuer, any initial preparation for that Issuer will be
performed, e.g. for the ACME issuer, an account is registered with the ACME
server specified in the spec, and a corresponding private key generated too if
required.

Multiple Issuers may exist at any one time, and they should be referenced by
name in a Certificate resource. The Issuer and Certificate resource must exist
in the same namespace, as cert-manager does not allow the traversal of
namespace boundaries.

### 3. Create a Certificate resource

Now we have an Issuer configured, we can create a Certificate resource that
uses it. A Certificate represents the lifecycle of a TLS certificate in your
cluster. When a Certificate is created, cert-manager will verify the
certificate is valid for the requested domains and if not, will attempt to
retrieve a signed Certificate from the specified Issuer.

```yaml
## Example Certificate that uses multiple challenge mechanisms to obtain
## a SAN certificate for multiple domains from the letsencrypt-staging issuer.
apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: example-com
spec:
  # The name of the Kubernetes secret resource to store the signed TLS keypair
  secretName: example-com
  # The Issuer to use for this certificate
  issuer: letsencrypt-staging
  # A list of domains to include on the TLS certificate
  domains:
  - example.com
  - www.example.com
  - example2.com
  acme:
    # A pairing of domains to challenge types for the ACME provider to use
    # when attempting to validate domain ownership for the listed domains
    config:
    - domains:
      - example.com
      - www.example.com
      http-01:
        ingressClass: nginx
    - domains:
      - example2.com
      dns-01:
        provider: prod-dns
```

### 4. Ensuring the Certificate request has been fulfiled

> Currently, cert-manager does not log Events on Certificates or Issuers to the
Kubernetes Events API (see [#54](https://github.com/jetstack-experimental/cert-manager/issues/54)).

Until then, we can view the logs of cert-manager with the following:

```
$ kubectl logs -l app=cert-manager

```

You can also check the signed TLS keypair exists with:

```
$ kubectl get secret -o yaml example-com
```

You should see a base64 encoded TLS keypair if issuance was successful.
