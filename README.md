# cert-manager

cert-manager is a Kubernetes add-on to automate the management and issuance of
TLS certificates from various issuing sources.

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date periodically, and attempt
to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry.

It is loosely based upon the work of [kube-lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego)
and has borrowed some wisdom from other similar projects e.g.
[kube-cert-manager](https://github.com/PalmStoneGames/kube-cert-manager).

## Importing cert-manager as a Module

⚠️ Please note that cert-manager **does not** currently provide a Go module compatibility guarantee. That means that
**most code under `pkg/` is subject to change in a breaking way**, even between minor or patch releases and even if
the code is currently publicly exported.

The lack of a Go module compatibility guarantee does not affect API version guarantees
under the [Kubernetes Deprecation Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/).

For more details see [Importing cert-manager in Go](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/importing/) on the
cert-manager website.

The import path for cert-manager versions 1.8 and later is `github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager`.

For all versions of cert-manager before 1.8, including minor and patch releases, the import path is `github.com/jetstack/cert-manager`.

## Security Reporting

Security is the number one priority for cert-manager. If you think you've found
a security vulnerability, we'd love to hear from you.

Please follow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) to report a
vulnerability to the team.
