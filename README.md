# cert-manager

cert-manager adds certificates and certificate issuers as resource types in Kubernetes clusters, and simplifies the process of obtaining, renewing and using those certificates.

It supports issuing certificates from a variety of sources, including Let's Encrypt (ACME), HashiCorp Vault, and Venafi TPP / TLS Protect Cloud, as well as local in-cluster issuance.

cert-manager also ensures certificates remain valid and up to date, attempting to renew certificates at an appropriate time before expiry to reduce the risk of outages and remove toil.

## Importing cert-manager as a Module

⚠️ Please note that cert-manager **does not** currently provide a Go module compatibility guarantee. That means that
**most code under `pkg/` is subject to change in a breaking way**, even between minor or patch releases and even if
the code is currently publicly exported.

The lack of a Go module compatibility guarantee does not affect API version guarantees
under the [Kubernetes Deprecation Policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/).

For more details see [Importing cert-manager in Go](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/importing/) on the
cert-manager website.

The import path for cert-manager versions 1.8 and later is `github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager`.

For all versions of cert-manager before 1.8, including minor and patch releases, the import path is `github.com/jetstack/cert-manager`.

## Security Reporting

Security is the number one priority for cert-manager. If you think you've found a security vulnerability, we'd love to hear from you.

Follow the instructions in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) to make a report.

## Changelog

[Every release](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases) on GitHub has a changelog,
and we also publish release notes on [the website](https://cert-manager.io/docs/release-notes/).

## History

cert-manager is loosely based upon the work of [kube-lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego)
and has borrowed some wisdom from other similar projects such as [kube-cert-manager](https://github.com/PalmStoneGames/kube-cert-manager).
