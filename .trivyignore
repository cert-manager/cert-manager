# These vulns relate to issues with v1 of the AWS Golang SDK
# These issues relate to S3 encryption issues which cert-manager is unlikely to hit
# Fixing them requires upgrading to v2 of the AWS Golang SDK which is a potentially large task

# These Helm vulnerabilities do not create a security risk for the cmctl binary.
# Since the cmctl x install command uses the trusted cert-manager Helm chart, and
# these vulnerabilities require a malicious chart to be used.

# CVE-2019-25210 is a problem in `helm --dry-run` which the Helm maintainers say was intentional and isn't a bug
# It certainly doesn't seem like a risk for our uses of Helm.

# CVE-2024-24557 is a CVE in the docker CLI, which we're not using

# CVE-2020-8559 is a vuln in old Kubernetes versions which seems to be incorrectly flagged by trivy. It seems like
# the version detection is wrongly looking at apiserver packages with versions < 1 - but all apiserver packages have
# a major version of 0. In any case this is a vuln in Kubernetes clusters, not in our code.
CVE-2020-8559

# The DLA-* "vulnerabilities" below refer to an out-of-date timezone database in Debian 11 (bullseye).
# The Debian 11 tzdata package has been updated to address the issue,
# but cert-manager uses github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless base images,
# where Debian 11 is no longer supported.
# So we have no easy way to address this vulnerability without switching to Debian 12,
# which would be too big of a change for a cert-manager 1.12.x patch release.
# cert-manager 1.12 will be out of support in May 2025 so we have decided to
# simply suppress this trivy warning until then.
