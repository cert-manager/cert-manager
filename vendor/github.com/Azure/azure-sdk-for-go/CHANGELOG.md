### Storage
Storage has returned to this repo.
It has also been refactored:
- Blobs, containers, tables, etc are now method receivers. These structs are the ones being
  updated with each operation.
- When creating a client, the SDK checks if the storage account provided is valid.
- Added retry logic. It provides the flexibility for user to provide their own retry logic.
- Added operations:
   - Get table
   - Get entity
   - Get and set queue ACL
   - Table batch
   - Page blob incremental copy
- All operations that previously had `extraHeaders` as parameter now recieve a struct with well
  defined possible headers and other options. Some functions are easier to use.
- Storage tests now use HTTP recordings.

### Generated code notes
- [Azure REST API specs](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs) commit: 519980465d9c195622d466dc4601b1999a448ed5
- [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) commit: ced950d64e39735b84d41876a56b54b27c227dc7

## `v9.0.0-beta`
### ARM
In addition to the tabulated changes below, each package had the following updates:
 - API Version is now associated with individual methods, instead of the client. This was done to
   support composite swaggers, which logically may contain more than one API Version.
 - Version numbers are now calculated in the generator instead of at runtime. This keeps us from
   adding new allocations, while removing the race-conditions that were added.

### Storage
Storage has been moved to its own repository which can be found here:
https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-go

For backwards compatibility, a submodule has been added to this repo. However, consuming storage
via this repository is deprecated and may be deleted in future versions.

- Uses go-autorest v7.3.0


## `v8.0.0-beta`
### ARM
- In addition to the tablulated changes below, all updated packages received performance
  improvements to their Version() method.
- Some validation that was taking place in the runtime was erroneously blocking calls.
  all packages have been updated to take that bug fix.

### Storage
- Can now update messages in storage queues.
- Added support for blob snapshots and aborting blob copy operations.
- Added support for getting and setting ACLs on containers.
- Added various APIs for file and directory manipulation.

### Support for the following swagger extensions was added to the Go generator which affected codegen.
- x-ms-client-flatten
- x-ms-paramater-location

continue to change substantially, the ARM packages are still in *beta* status.

The ARM packages now align with the following API versions (*highlighted* packages are new or
updated in this release):

------

## v0.1.0-beta

This release addresses the issues raised against the alpha release and adds more features. Most
notably, to address the challenges of encoding JSON
(see the [comments](https://github.com/Azure/go-autorest#handling-empty-values) in the
[go-autorest](https://github.com/Azure/go-autorest) package) by using pointers for *all* structure
fields (with the exception of enumerations). The
[go-autorest/autorest/to](https://github.com/Azure/go-autorest/tree/master/autorest/to) package
provides helpers to convert to / from pointers. The examples demonstrate their usage.

Additionally, the packages now align with Go coding standards and pass both `golint` and `govet`.
Accomplishing this required renaming various fields and parameters (such as changing Url to URL).

##### Changes

- Changed request / response structures to use pointer fields.
- Changed methods to return `error` instead of `autorest.Error`.
- Re-divided methods to ease asynchronous requests.
- Added paged results support.
- Added a UserAgent string.
- Added changes necessary to pass golint and govet.
- Updated README.md with details on asynchronous requests and paging.
- Saved package dependencies through Godep (for the entire SDK).

##### Fixed Issues:

- https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/issues/205
- https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/issues/206
- https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-go/issues/211
