⚠️  WARNING: New default private key rotation policy for Certificate resources.
The default private key rotation policy for Certificate resources was
changed to `Always` in cert-manager >= v1.18.0.

cert-manager {{ .Chart.AppVersion }} has been deployed successfully!

In order to begin issuing certificates, you will need to set up a ClusterIssuer
or Issuer resource (for example, by creating a 'letsencrypt-staging' issuer).

More information on the different types of issuers and how to configure them
can be found in our documentation:

https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/

For information on how to configure cert-manager to automatically provision
Certificates for Ingress resources, take a look at the `ingress-shim`
documentation:
