          A CertificateRequest is used to request a signed certificate from one of the
          configured issuers.

          All fields within the CertificateRequest's `spec` are immutable after creation.
          A CertificateRequest will either succeed or fail, as denoted by its `Ready` status
          condition and its `status.failureTime` field.

          A CertificateRequest is a one-shot resource, meaning it represents a single
          point in time request for a certificate and cannot be re-used.
