                                            Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                            differently based on the type of parent resource.


                                            When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                            listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                            select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                            networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                            as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                            and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                            must match both specified values.


                                            <gateway:experimental:description>
                                            When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                                            Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                                            the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.

                                            Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                            Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                                            document how/if Port is interpreted.


                                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                            long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                            from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                            the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                            SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                                            following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:


                                            * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                            are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                                            both specified values.
                                            * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                                            Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                                            If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                            interpreted.


                                            When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                                            For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                                            least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                                            listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                            namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                                            the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                            attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                                            Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                                            MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                            be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                            incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`
                                                            to select the group of existing pods which pods will be taken into consideration
                                                            for the incoming pod's pod (anti) affinity. Keys that don't exist in the incoming
                                                            pod labels will be ignored. The default value is empty.
                                                            The same key is forbidden to exist in both mismatchLabelKeys and labelSelector.
                                                            Also, mismatchLabelKeys cannot be set when labelSelector isn't set.
