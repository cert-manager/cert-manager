                                In this case this `region` field value is ignored.

                                      Kind is kind of the referent.

                                      There are two kinds of parent resources with "Core" support:

                                      * Gateway (Gateway conformance profile)
                                      * Service (Mesh conformance profile, ClusterIP Services only)

                                      Support for other resources is Implementation-Specific.

                                      Namespace is the namespace of the referent. When unspecified, this refers
                                      to the local namespace of the Route.

                                      Note that there are specific rules for ParentRefs which cross namespace
                                      boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                                      allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                                      Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                                      generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                                      routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                                      any namespace to the Service.

                                      ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                                      "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                                      connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                                      the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                                      ParentRef of the Route.

                                      Port is the network port this Route targets. It can be interpreted
                                      differently based on the type of parent resource.

                                      When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners
                                      listening on the specified port that also support this kind of Route(and
                                      select this Route). It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the
                                      networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port
                                      as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                                      and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                                      must match both specified values.

                                      Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                                      Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                                      document how/if Port is interpreted.

                                      For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                                      long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                                      listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                      namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                                      from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                      attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                                      the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                      SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                                      following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                                      * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                                      are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                                      both specified values.
                                      * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                                      Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                                      If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                                      interpreted.

                                      When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                                      For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                                      least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                                      listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                                      namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                                      the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                                      attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                                      Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                                                          MismatchLabelKeys is a set of pod label keys to select which pods will
                                                          be taken into consideration. The keys are used to lookup values from the
                                                          incoming pod labels, those key-value labels are merged with `labelSelector` as `key notin (value)`

                                              If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can

                                              Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                                              When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                                              Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                                              If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                                              Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                                              Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                              Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                              tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                              TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                                              of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                                              it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                              negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        with the lowest priority, i.e. if any other solver has a more specific

                            If specified and a match is found, a dnsNames selector will take
                            precedence over a dnsZones selector.
                            If multiple solvers match with the same dnsNames value, the solver
                            with the most matching labels in matchLabels will be selected.
                            If neither has more matches, the solver defined earlier in the list
                            will be selected.

                            over other DNS zone matches, so a solver specifying sys.example.com

                            If neither has more matches, the solver defined earlier in the list
