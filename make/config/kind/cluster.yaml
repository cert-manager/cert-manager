# This kind config is unversioned as we are using it to create kind clusters with a range of different versions of Kubernetes. Having the config unversioned allows kind to choose a suitable API version, see https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1839#issuecomment-1148968204
# When making changes to this file ensure that the change works with all currently supported versions of Kubernetes.

# The --unsafe-no-fsync decreases the load on the pod's filesystem [1], which in
# turn decreases the end-to-end tests duration. It is OK for us to use this flag
# because we are using a one-node etcd cluster. The fsync feature is used for
# the raft consensus protocol and is thus only useful when using 3 or more etcd
# nodes.

# Custom service subnet allows us to have a fixed/predictable clusterIP for
# various addon Services such as ingress-nginx, Gateway etc.
# TODO: parameterize the service subnet range instead of hardcoding it so that it is defined in one place only
# It could be interpolated with ytt like for addons i.e https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/blob/134398e939bb2b1401697eaf589405ad469cd609/make/e2e-setup.mk#L379
