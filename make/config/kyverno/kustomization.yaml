# This Kustomization is used to adapt the Kyverno policies downloaded from
# https://kyverno.io/policies/, for use in the cert-manager
# namespace and in the E2E test namespaces.
#
# * Changes the failure action of all ClusterPolicy resources from Audit to Enforce.
# * Adds exclude` fields to all ClusterPolicy resources to allow the
#   installation of non-compliant E2E test components such as ingress-nginx and
#   pebble.
#   The method used is a bit of a hack, because it is difficult to get Kustomize
#   to patch **all** the rules in the Kyverno ClusterPolicy custom resource.
#   See https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/issues/2408#issuecomment-1125926525
#
# Use as follows:
#  kustomize build . > policy.yaml
