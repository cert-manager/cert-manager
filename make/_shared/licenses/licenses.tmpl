This LICENSES file is generated by the `licenses` module in makefile-modules[0].

The licenses below the "---" are determined by the go-licenses tool[1].

The aim of this file is to collect the licenses of all dependencies, and provide
a single source of truth for licenses used by this project.

## For Developers

If CI reports that this file is out of date, you should be careful to check that the
new licenses are acceptable for this project before running `make generate-go-licenses`
to update this file.

Acceptable licenses are those allowlisted by the CNCF[2].

You MUST NOT add any new dependencies whose licenses are not allowlisted by the CNCF,
or which do not have an explicit license exception[3].

## For Users

If this file was included in a release artifact, it is a snapshot of the licenses of all dependencies at the time of the release.

You can retrieve the actual license text by following these steps:

1. Find the dependency name in this file
2. Go to the source code repository of this project, and go to the tag corresponding to this release.
3. Find the exact version of the dependency in the `go.mod` file
4. Search for the dependency at the correct version in the [Go package index](https://pkg.go.dev/).
