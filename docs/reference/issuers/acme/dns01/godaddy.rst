This provider uses a Kubernetes ``Secret`` Resource to work. In the
following example, the secret will have to be named ``godaddy-dns``
and have a subkey ``apiSecret`` with the token in it.

To create a Personnal Access Token, see `Godaddy documentation <https://developer.godaddy.com/getstarted/>`_.
