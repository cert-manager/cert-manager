=========================
HTTP01 Challenge Provider
=========================

In order to allow HTTP01 challenges to be solved, we must enable the HTTP01
challenge provider on our Issuer resource.

This is done through setting the ``http01`` field on the ``issuer.spec.acme``
stanza. Cert-manager will then attempt to solve ACME HTTP-01 challenges by
using Ingress resources
