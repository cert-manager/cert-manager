# Deploying cert-manager using Helm

The recommended deployment tool for cert-manager is Helm. We ship a Helm chart
with each release that is end-to-end tested in an RBAC enabled environment.

## Deploying with Helm

### Step 0 - setting up and configuring Helm/Tiller

Before deploying cert-manager, you must ensure [Tiller](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm)
is up and running in your cluster. Tiller is the server side component to Helm.

Your cluster administrator may have already setup and configured Helm for you, in which case you can skip this step.

Full documentation on installing Helm can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/install.md).

If your cluster has RBAC (Role Based Access Control) enabled (default in GKE v1.7+), you will need to take
special care when deploying Tiller, to ensure Tiller has permission to create
resources as a cluster administrator. More information on deploying Helm with
RBAC can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/blob/master/docs/rbac.md).

### Step 1 - deploying cert-manager

To deploy the latest version of cert-manager using Helm you will first need to
clone this repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager
$ cd cert-manager
# check out the latest release tag to ensure we use a supported version of cert-manager
$ git checkout -b v0.2.3
```

We can then go ahead and install the bundled chart:

```bash
$ helm install \
    --name cert-manager \
    --namespace kube-system \
    contrib/charts/cert-manager
```

> **NOTE**: if your cluster does not use RBAC (Role Based Access Control), you should add `--set rbac.create=false` when running your `helm install` command.

The default cert-manager configuration is good for the majority of users, but a
full list of the available options can be found in the [Helm chart README](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/contrib/charts/cert-manager/README.md).

Next, you will need to configure cert-manager with Issuers and ClusterIssuers.
These represent a 'source' for x509 certificates and will be used later on to
issue certificates.

## Addendum

* If your cluster does not use RBAC, you should add `--set rbac.create=false` to
your `helm install` command. All RBAC related resources will not be created in
this instance.

* To add support for automatically creating Certificates for Ingress resources
with the `kubernetes.io/tls-acme` annotation (similar to [kube-lego](https://github.com/jetstack/kube-lego)),
you should deploy cert-manager with additional flags in order to specify the
Issuer (or ClusterIssuer) responsible for acquiring these certificates. This
can be done by adding the following additional `--set` command when running
`helm install` (replacing the values accordingly):

```
--set ingressShim.extraArgs='{--default-issuer-name=letsencrypt-prod,--default-issuer-kind=ClusterIssuer}'
```

In the above example, cert-manager will create Certificate resources that reference the ClusterIssuer `letsencrypt-prod` for all Ingresses that have a `kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"` annotation.

You can find more information on the ingress-shim (the component responsible
for this) [here](ingress-shim.md).
