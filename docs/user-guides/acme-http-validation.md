# Issuing an ACME certificate using HTTP validation

cert-manager can be used to obtain certificates from a CA using the [ACME][1] protocol. The ACME protocol supports various challenge mechanisms which are used to prove ownership of a domain so that a valid certificate can be issued for that domain. One such challenge mechanism is the HTTP-01 challenge. With a HTTP-01 challenge, you prove ownership of a domain by ensuring that a particular file is present at the domain. It is assumed that you control the domain if you are able to publish the given file under a given path.

The following `Issuer` defines the necessary information to enable HTTP validation. You can read more about the `Issuer` resource [here][5].

```yaml
apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-staging
  namespace: default
spec:
  acme:
    # The ACME server URL
    server: https://acme-staging.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # Email address used for ACME registration
    email: user@example.com
    # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-staging
    # Enable the HTTP-01 challenge provider
    http01: {}
```

We have specified the ACME server URL for Let's Encrypt's [staging environment][3]. The staging environment will not issue trusted certificates but is used to ensure that the verification process is working properly before moving to production. Let's Encrypt's production environment imposes much stricter [rate limits][4], so to reduce the chance of you hitting those limits it is highly recommended to start by using the staging environment. To move to production, simply create a new `Issuer` with the URL set to `https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory`.

The first stage of the ACME protocol is for the client to register with the ACME server. This phase includes generating an asymmetric key pair which is then associated with the email address specified in the `Issuer`. Make sure to change this email address to a valid one that you own. This is commonly used to send expiry notices when your certificates are coming up for renewal. The generated private key is stored in a `Secret` called `letsencrypt-staging`.

The presence of the `http01` field simply enables the HTTP-01 challenge for this `Issuer`. No further configuration is necessary or currently possible.

Once we have created the above `Issuer` we can use it to obtain a certificate.

```yaml
apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: example-com
  namespace: default
spec:
  secretName: example-com-tls
  issuerRef:
    name: letsencrypt-staging
  commonName: example.com
  dnsNames:
  - www.example.com
  acme:
    config:
    - http01:
        ingressClass: nginx
      domains:
      - example.com
    - http01:
        ingress: my-ingress
      domains:
      - www.example.com
```

The `Certificate` resource describes our desired certificate and the possible methods that can be used to obtain it. You can learn more about the `Certificate` resource [here][4]. If the certificate is obtained successfully, the resulting key pair will be stored in a secret called `example-com-tls` in the same namespace as the `Certificate`. The certificate will have a common name of `example.com` and the [Subject Alternative Names][6] (SANs) will be `example.com` and `www.example.com`.

In our `Certificate` we have referenced the `letsencrypt-staging` `Issuer` above. The `Issuer` must be in the same namespace as the `Certificate`. If you want to reference a `ClusterIssuer`, which is a cluster-scoped version of an `Issuer`, you must add `kind: ClusterIssuer` to the `issuerRef` stanza. For more information on `ClusterIssuers`, read the [Creating cluster wide Issuers][7] user guide.

The `acme` stanza defines the configuration for our ACME challenges. Here we have defined the configuration for our HTTP-01 challenges which will be used to verify domain ownership. To verify ownership of each domain mentioned in an `http01` stanza, cert-manager will create a `Pod` that exposes an HTTP endpoint that satisfies the HTTP-01 challenge. For each `http01` stanza, cert-manager will create or modify an `Ingress` resource in the same namespace as the `Certificate` with the correct rules to route incoming challenge requests to the `Pods` corresponding to the domains in that stanza.

The fields `ingress` and `ingressClass` in the `http01` stanza can be used to control how cert-manager interacts with `Ingress` resources:

* If the `ingress` field is specified, then an `Ingress` resource with the same name in the same namespace as the `Certificate` must already exist and it will be modified only to add the appropriate rules to solve the challenge. This field is useful for the GCLB ingress controller, as well as a number of others, that assign a single public IP address for each ingress resource. Without manual intervention, creating a new ingress resource would cause any challenges to fail.
* If the `ingressClass` field is specified, a new ingress resource with a randomly generated name will be created in order to solve the challenge. This new resource will have an annotation with key `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` and value set to the value of the `ingressClass` field. This works for the likes of the NGINX `Ingress` controller.
* If neither are specified, new ingress resources will be created with a randomly generated name, but they will not have the ingress class annotation set.
* If both are specified, then the `ingress` field will take precedence.

Once domain ownership has been verified, any cert-manager affected resources will be cleaned up or deleted. Note that it is your responsibilty to point each domain name at the correct IP address for your ingress controller.

After creating the above `Certificate`, we can check whether it has been obtained successfully using `kubectl describe`:

```
$ kubectl describe certificate example-com

```

You can also check whether issuance was successful with `kubectl get secret example-com-tls -o yaml`. You should see a base64 encoded signed TLS key pair.

Once our certificate has been obtained, cert-manager will periodically check its validity and attempt to renew it if it gets close to expiry. cert-manager considers certificates to be close to expiry when the 'Not After' field on the certificate is less than the current time plus 30 days.
