========================================
Welcome to cert-manager's documentation!
========================================

cert-manager is a native Kubernetes_ certificate management controller.
It can help with issuing certificates from a variety of sources, such as
`Let's Encrypt`_, `HashiCorp Vault`_, a simple signing keypair, or self signed.

It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date, and attempt to renew
certificates at a configured time before expiry.

It is loosely based upon the work of kube-lego_ and has borrowed some wisdom
from other similar projects e.g. kube-cert-manager_.
