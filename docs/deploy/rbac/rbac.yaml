    # TODO: remove endpoints once 0.4 is released. We include it here in case
    # users use the 'master' version of the Helm chart with a 0.2.x release of
    # cert-manager that still performs leader election with Endpoint resources.
    # We advise users don't do this, but some will anyway and this will reduce
    # friction.
