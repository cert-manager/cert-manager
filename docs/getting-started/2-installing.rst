2. Installing cert-manager
==========================

With Helm
==========

Using Helm is the recommended way to deploy cert-manager. We publish a stable
version of the chart to the public `charts repository`_.

You can install the chart with the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ helm install \
        --name cert-manager \
        --namespace kube-system \
        stable/cert-manager

The default cert-manager configuration is good for the majority of users, but a
full list of the available options can be found in the `Helm chart README`_.

.. note::
   If your cluster does not use RBAC (Role Based Access Control), you
   will need to disable creation of RBAC resources by adding
   ``--set rbac.create=false`` to your ``helm install`` command above.

.. note::
   If you are upgrading from a previous release, please check the :doc:`upgrading guide </admin/upgrading>`
   for special considerations.

With static manifests
=====================

As some users may not be able to run Tiller in their own environment, static
Kubernetes deployment manifests are provided which can be used to install
cert-manager.

You can get a copy of the static manifests from the `deploy directory`_.
