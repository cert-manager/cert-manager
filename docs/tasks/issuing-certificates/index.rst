Issuing Certificates
====================

The Certificate resource type is used to request certificates from different
Issuers.

In order to issue any certificates, you'll need to configure an Issuer resource
first.

If you have not configured any issuers yet, you should read the
:doc:`Setting up Issuers <../issuers/index>` guide.

Creating Certificate resources
==============================

A Certificate resource specifies fields that are used to generated certificate
signing requests which are then fulfilled by the issuer type you have
referenced.

Certificates specify which issuer they want to obtain the certificate from by
specifying the ``certificate.spec.issuerRef`` field.

A basic Certificate resource, for the ``example.com`` and ``www.example.com``
DNS names that is valid for 90d and renews 15d before expiry is below:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 9, 10, 11, 12

   apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Certificate
   metadata:
     name: example-com
     namespace: default
   spec:
     secretName: example-com-tls
     duration: 2160h # 90d
     renewBefore: 360h # 15d
     commonName: example.com
     dnsNames:
     - example.com
     - www.example.com
     issuerRef:
       name: ca-issuer
       # We can reference ClusterIssuers by changing the kind here.
       # The default value is Issuer (i.e. a locally namespaced Issuer)
       kind: Issuer

The signed certificate will be stored in a Secret resource named
``example-com-tls`` once the issuer has successfully issued the requested
certificate.

The Certificate will be issued using the issuer named ``ca-issuer`` in the
``default`` namespace (the same namespace as the Certificate resource).

.. note::
   If you want to create an Issuer that can be referenced by Certificate
   resources in **all** namespaces, you should create a
   :doc:`ClusterIssuer </reference/clusterissuers>` resource and set the
   ``certificate.spec.issuerRef.kind`` field to ``ClusterIssuer``.

.. note::
   The ``renewBefore`` and ``duration`` fields must be specified using Golang's
   ``time.Time`` string format, which does not allow the ``d`` (days) suffix.
   You must specify these values using ``s``, ``m`` and ``h`` suffixes instead.
   Failing to do so without installing the
   :doc:`webhook </getting-started/webhook>` component can prevent cert-manager
   from functioning correctly (`#1269`_).

.. note::
   Take care when setting the ``renewBefore`` field to be very close to the
   ``duration`` as this can lead to a renewal loop, where the Certificate is
   always in the renewal period. Some Issuers set the ``notBefore`` field on
   their issued X.509 certificate before the issue time to fix clock-skew
   issues, leading to the working duration of a certificate to be less than
   the full duration of the certificate. For example, Let's Encrypt sets it
   to be one hour before issue time, so the actual *working duration* of the
   certificate is 89 days, 23 hours (the *full duration* remains 90 days).

A full list of the fields supported on the Certificate resource can be found in
the `API reference documentation`_.

Temporary certificates whilst issuing
=====================================

With some Issuer types, certificates can take a few minutes to be issued.

A temporary untrusted certificate will be issued whilst this process takes
places if another certificate does not already exist in the target Secret
resource.

This helps to improve compatibility with certain ingress controllers (e.g.
ingress-gce_) which require a TLS certificate to be present at all times in
order to function.

After the real, valid certificate has been obtained, cert-manager will replace
the temporary self signed certificate with the valid one, **but will retain the
same private key**.

You can disable issuing temporary certificate by setting feature gate flag
``--feature-gates=IssueTemporaryCertificate=false``
