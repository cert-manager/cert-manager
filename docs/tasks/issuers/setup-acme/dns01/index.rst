Configuring DNS01 Challenge Providers
=====================================

This page contains details on the different options available on the ``Issuer``
resource's DNS01 challenge solver configuration.

For more information on configuring ACME issuers and their API format, read the
:doc:`Setting up ACME Issuers <../index>` documentation.

DNS01 provider configuration must be specified on the Issuer resource, similar
to the examples in the setting up documentation:

You can read about how the DNS01 challenge type works on the
`Let's Encrypt challenge types page`_.

.. _`Let's Encrypt challenge types page`: https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#dns-01-challenge


.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 12-17

   apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha2
   kind: Issuer
   metadata:
     name: example-issuer
   spec:
     acme:
       email: user@example.com
       server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
       privateKeySecretRef:
         name: example-issuer-account-key
       solvers:
       - dns01:
           clouddns:
             project: my-project
             serviceAccountSecretRef:
               name: prod-clouddns-svc-acct-secret
               key: service-account.json

Each issuer can specify multiple different DNS01 challenge providers, and
it is also possible to have multiple instances of the same DNS provider on a
single Issuer (e.g. two clouddns accounts could be set, each with their own
name).

For more information on utilising multiple solver types on a single Issuer,
read the multiple-solver-types_ section.

Setting nameservers for DNS01 self check
========================================

cert-manager will check the correct DNS records exist before attempting a DNS01
challenge.
By default, the DNS servers for this check will be taken from
``/etc/resolv.conf``.
If this is not desired (for example with multiple authoritative nameservers or
split-horizon DNS), the cert-manager controller exposes a flag that allows you
alter this behaviour:

Example usage::

    --dns01-recursive-nameservers "8.8.8.8:53,1.1.1.1:53"

.. _supported-dns01-providers:

Delegated Domains for DNS01
===========================

By default, cert-manager will not follow CNAME records pointing to subdomains.

If granting cert-manager access to the root DNS zone is not desired, then the
_acme-challenge.example.com subdomain can instead be delegated to some other,
less privileged domain.
Once a CNAME record has been configured to point at the desired domain, and the
DNS configuration/credentials for the zone that *should be updated* have been
provided, all that is left to be done is adding an additional field into the
relevant `dns01` solver:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 11

   apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha2
   kind: Issuer
   metadata:
     ...
   spec:
     acme:
       ...
       solvers:
       - dns01:
           # Valid values are None and Follow
           cnameStrategy: Follow
           clouddns:
             ...

cert-manager will then follow CNAME records recursively in order to determine
which DNS zone to update during DNS01 challenges.
