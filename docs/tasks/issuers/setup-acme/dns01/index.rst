Configuring DNS01 Challenge Providers
=====================================

This page contains details on the different options available on the ``Issuer``
resource's DNS01 challenge solver configuration.

For more information on configuring ACME issuers and their API format, read the
:doc:`Setting up ACME Issuers <../index>` documentation.

DNS01 provider configuration must be specified on the Issuer resource, similar
to the examples in the setting up documentation:

You can read about how the DNS01 challenge type works on the
`Let's Encrypt challenge types page`_.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 12-17

   apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Issuer
   metadata:
     name: example-issuer
   spec:
     acme:
       email: user@example.com
       server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
       privateKeySecretRef:
         name: example-issuer-account-key
       solvers:
       - dns01:
           clouddns:
             project: my-project
             serviceAccountSecretRef:
               name: prod-clouddns-svc-acct-secret
               key: service-account.json

Each issuer can specify multiple different DNS01 challenge providers, and
it is also possible to have multiple instances of the same DNS provider on a
single Issuer (e.g. two clouddns accounts could be set, each with their own
name).

For more information on utilising multiple solver types on a single Issuer,
read the multiple-solver-types_ section.

Setting nameservers for DNS01 self check
========================================

cert-manager will check the correct DNS records exist before attempting a DNS01
challenge.
By default, the DNS servers for this check will be taken from
``/etc/resolv.conf``.
If this is not desired (for example with multiple authoritative nameservers or
split-horizon DNS), the cert-manager controller exposes a flag that allows you
alter this behaviour:

Example usage::

    --dns01-recursive-nameservers "8.8.8.8:53,1.1.1.1:53"
