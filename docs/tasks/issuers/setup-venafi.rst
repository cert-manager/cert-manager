=========================
Setting up Venafi Issuers
=========================

The Venafi Issuer types allows you to obtain certificates from `Venafi Cloud`_
and `Venafi Trust Protection Platform`_ instances.

Register your account at https://ui.venafi.cloud/enroll and get an API key from
your dashboard.

You can have multiple different Venafi Issuer types installed within the same
cluster, including mixtures of Cloud and TPP issuer types. This allows you to
be flexible with the types of Venafi account you use.

Automated certificate renewal and management are provided for Certificates
using the Venafi issuer.

.. note::
   The Venafi Issuer has been recently added, and the exact structure of the
   Issuer resource is subject to change. Such changes will be clearly
   documented, and migration steps will be provided.

Creating an Issuer resource
===========================

A single Venafi Issuer represents a single 'zone' within the Venafi API,
therefore you must create an Issuer resource for each Venafi Zone you want to
obtain certificates from.

You can configure your Issuer resource to either issue certificates only within
a single namespace, or cluster-wide (using a ClusterIssuer resource).
For more information on the distinction between Issuer and ClusterIssuer
resources, read the :ref:`issuer_vs_clusterissuer` section.


Creating a Venafi Cloud Issuer
------------------------------

In order to set up a Venafi Cloud Issuer, you must first create a Kubernetes
Secret resource containing your Venafi Cloud API credentials:

.. code-block:: shell

   kubectl create secret generic \
        cloud-secret \
        --namespace='NAMESPACE OF YOUR ISSUER RESOURCE' \
        --from-literal=apikey='YOUR_CLOUD_API_KEY_HERE'

.. note::
   If you are configuring your Issuer as a ClusterIssuer resource in order to
   issue Certificates across your whole cluster, you must set the
   ``--namespace`` parameter to ``cert-manager``, which is the default 'cluster
   resource namespace'.

This API key will be used by cert-manager to interact with the Venafi Cloud
service on your behalf.

Once the API key Secret has been created, you can create your Issuer or
ClusterIssuer resource. If you are creating a ClusterIssuer resource, you must
change the ``kind`` field to ``ClusterIssuer`` and remove the
``metadata.namespace`` field.

Save the below content after making your amendments to a file named
``venafi-cloud-issuer.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Issuer
   metadata:
     name: cloud-venafi-issuer
     namespace: <NAMESPACE YOU WANT TO ISSUE CERTIFICATES IN>
   spec:
     venafi:
       zone: "DevOps" # Set this to the Venafi policy zone you want to use
       cloud:
         apiTokenSecretRef:
           name: cloud-secret
           key: apikey

You can then create the Issuer using ``kubectl create -f``:

.. code-block:: shell

   kubectl create -f venafi-cloud-issuer.yaml

Verify the Issuer has been initialised correctly using ``kubectl describe``:

.. code-block:: shell

   kubectl describe issuer cloud-venafi-issuer --namespace='NAMESPACE OF YOUR ISSUER RESOURCE'

   (TODO) include sample output

You are now ready to issue certificates using the newly provisioned Venafi
Issuer.

Read the :doc:`Issuing Certificates <../issuing-certificates/index>` document
for more information on how to create Certificate resources.

Creating a Venafi Trust Protection Platform Issuer
--------------------------------------------------

The Venafi Trust Protection integration allows you to obtain certificates from
a properly configured Venafi TPP instance.

The setup is similar to the Venafi Cloud configuration above, however some of
the connection parameters are slightly different.

.. note::
   You **must** allow "User Provided CSRs" as part of your TPP policy, as this
   is the only type supported by cert-manager at this time.

In order to set up a Venafi Trust Protection Platform Issuer, you must first
create a Kubernetes Secret resource containing your Venafi TPP API credentials:

.. code-block:: shell

   kubectl create secret generic \
        tpp-secret \
        --namespace=<NAMESPACE OF YOUR ISSUER RESOURCE> \
        --from-literal=username='YOUR_TPP_USERNAME_HERE' \
        --from-literal=password='YOUR_TPP_PASSWORD_HERE'

.. note::
   If you are configuring your Issuer as a ClusterIssuer resource in order to
   issue Certificates across your whole cluster, you must set the
   ``--namespace`` parameter to ``cert-manager``, which is the default 'cluster
   resource namespace'.

These credentials will be used by cert-manager to interact with your Venafi TPP
instance.

Once the Secret containing credentials has been created, you can create your
Issuer or ClusterIssuer resource. If you are creating a ClusterIssuer resource,
you must change the ``kind`` field to ``ClusterIssuer`` and remove the
``metadata.namespace`` field.

Save the below content after making your amendments to a file named
``venafi-tpp-issuer.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
   kind: Issuer
   metadata:
     name: tpp-venafi-issuer
     namespace: <NAMESPACE YOU WANT TO ISSUE CERTIFICATES IN>
   spec:
     venafi:
       zone: devops\cert-manager # Set this to the Venafi policy zone you want to use
       tpp:
         url: https://tpp.venafi.example/vedsdk # Change this to the URL of your TPP instance
         caBundle: <base64 encoded string of caBundle PEM file>
         credentialsRef:
           name: tpp-secret

You can then create the Issuer using ``kubectl create -f``:

.. code-block:: shell

   kubectl create -f venafi-tpp-issuer.yaml

Verify the Issuer has been initialised correctly using ``kubectl describe``:

.. code-block:: shell

   kubectl describe issuer tpp-venafi-issuer --namespace='NAMESPACE OF YOUR ISSUER RESOURCE'

   (TODO) include sample output

You are now ready to issue certificates using the newly provisioned Venafi
Issuer.

Read the :doc:`Issuing Certificates <../issuing-certificates/index>` document
for more information on how to create Certificate resources.
