Migrating from kube-lego
========================

kube-lego_ is an older Jetstack project for obtaining TLS certificates from
Let's Encrypt (or another ACME server).

Since cert-managers release, kube-lego has been gradually deprecated in favour
of this project. There are a number of key differences between the two:

=========================================   ================================    =====================

This guide will walk through how you can safely migrate your kube-lego
installation to cert-manager, without service interruption.

By the end of the guide, we should have:

1. Scaled down and removed kube-lego

2. Installed cert-manager

3. Migrated ACME private key to cert-manager

4. Created an ACME ClusterIssuer using this private key, to issue certificates
   throughout your cluster

5. Configured cert-manager's :doc:`ingress-shim </reference/ingress-shim>` to
   automatically provision Certificate resources for all Ingress resources with
   the ``kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"`` annotation, using the ClusterIssuer
   we have created

6. Verified that the cert-manager installation is working


1. Scale down kube-lego
=======================

Before we begin deploying cert-manager, it is best we scale our kube-lego
deployment down to 0 replicas. This will prevent the two controllers
potentially 'fighting' each other. If you deployed kube-lego using the official
deployment YAMLs, a command like so should do:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ kubectl scale deployment kube-lego \
       --namespace kube-lego \
       --replicas=0 \

You can then verify your kube-lego pod is no longer running with:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ kubectl get pods --namespace kube-lego

2. Deploy cert-manager
======================

cert-manager should be deployed using Helm, according to our official
:doc:`/getting-started/index` guide. No special steps are required here. We will
return to this deployment at the end of this guide and perform an upgrade of
some of the CLI flags we deploy cert-manager with however.

Please take extra care to ensure you have configured RBAC correctly when
deploying Helm and cert-manager - there are some nuances described in our
deploying document!

3. Obtaining your ACME account private key
==========================================

In order to continue issuing and renewing certificates on your behalf, we need
to migrate the user account private key that kube-lego has created for you over
to cert-manager.

Your ACME user account identity is a private key, stored in a secret resource.
By default, kube-lego will store this key in a secret named ``kube-lego-account``
in the same namespace as your kube-lego Deployment. You may have overridden
this value when you deploy kube-lego, in which case the secret name to use will
be the value of the ``LEGO_SECRET_NAME`` environment variable.

You should download a copy of this secret resource and save it in your local
directory:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ kubectl get secret kube-lego-account -o yaml \
       --namespace kube-lego \
       --export > kube-lego-account.yaml

Once saved, open up this file and change the ``metadata.name`` field to something
more relevant to cert-manager. For the rest of this guide, we'll assume you
chose ``letsencrypt-private-key``.

Once done, we need to create this new resource in the ``kube-system`` namespace.
By default, cert-manager stores supporting resources for ClusterIssuers in the
namespace that it is running in, and we used ``kube-system`` when deploying
cert-manager above. You should change this if you have deployed cert-manager into
a different namespace.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ kubectl create -f kube-lego-account.yaml \
       --namespace kube-system

4. Creating an ACME ClusterIssuer using your old ACME account
=============================================================

We need to create a ClusterIssuer which will hold information about the ACME
account previously registered via kube-lego. In order to do so, we need two
more pieces of information from our old kube-lego deployment: the server URL of
the ACME server, and the email address used to register the account.

Both of these bits of information are stored within the kube-lego ConfigMap.

To retrieve them, you should be able to ``get`` the ConfigMap using ``kubectl``:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ kubectl get configmap kube-lego -o yaml \
       --namespace kube-lego \
       --export

Your email address should be shown under the ``.data.lego.email`` field, and the
ACME server URL under ``.data.lego.url``.

For the purposes of this guide, we will assume the lego email is
``user@example.com`` and the URL ``https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory``.

Now that we have migrated our private key to the new Secret resource, as well
as obtaining our ACME email address and URL, we can create a ClusterIssuer
resource!

Create a file named ``cluster-issuer.yaml``:

.. code-block:: yaml
   :linenos:
   :emphasize-lines: 11

   apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
   kind: ClusterIssuer
   metadata:
     # Adjust the name here accordingly
     name: letsencrypt-staging
   spec:
     acme:
       # The ACME server URL
       server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
       # Email address used for ACME registration
       email: user@example.com
       # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key from step 3
       privateKeySecretRef:
         name: letsencrypt-private-key
       # Enable the HTTP-01 challenge provider
       http01: {}

We then submit this file to our Kubernetes cluster:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ kubectl create -f cluster-issuer.yaml

You should be able to verify the ACME account has been verified successfully:

.. code-block:: shell
   :emphasize-lines: 26-31

   $ kubectl describe clusterissuer letsencrypt-staging
   Name:         letsencrypt-staging
   Namespace:
   Labels:       <none>
   Annotations:  <none>
   API Version:  certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
   Kind:         ClusterIssuer
   Metadata:
     Cluster Name:
     Creation Timestamp:  2017-11-30T22:33:40Z
     Generation:          0
     Resource Version:    4450170
     Self Link:           /apis/certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1/letsencrypt-staging
     UID:                 83d04e6b-d61e-11e7-ac26-42010a840044
   Spec:
     Acme:
       Email:  user@example.com
       Http 01:
       Private Key Secret Ref:
         Key:
         Name:  letsencrypt-private-key
       Server:  https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
   Status:
     Acme:
       Uri:  https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/11217539
     Conditions:
       Last Transition Time:  2018-04-12T17:32:30Z
       Message:               The ACME account was registered with the ACME server
       Reason:                ACMEAccountRegistered
       Status:                True
       Type:                  Ready

5. Configuring ingress-shim to use our new ClusterIssuer by default
===================================================================

Now that our ClusterIssuer is ready to issue certificates, we have one last
thing to do: we must reconfigure ingress-shim (deployed as part of
cert-manager) to automatically create Certificate resources for all Ingress
resources it finds with appropriate annotations.

More information on the role of ingress-shim can be found
:doc:`in the docs </reference/ingress-shim>`, but for now we can just run a
``helm upgrade`` in order to add a few additional flags. Assuming you've named
your ClusterIssuer ``letsencrypt-staging`` (as above), run:

.. code-block:: shell

   helm upgrade cert-manager \
       stable/cert-manager \
       --namespace kube-system \
       --set ingressShim.defaultIssuerName=letsencrypt-staging \
       --set ingressShim.defaultIssuerKind=ClusterIssuer

You should see the cert-manager pod be re-created, and once started it should
automatically create Certificate resources for all of your ingresses that
previously had kube-lego enabled.

6. Verify each ingress now has a corresponding Certificate
==========================================================

Before we finish, we should make sure there is now a Certificate resource for
each ingress resource you previously enabled kube-lego on.

You should be able to check this by running:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ kubectl get certificates --all-namespaces

There should be an entry for each ingress in your cluster with the kube-lego
annotation.

We can also verify that cert-manager has 'adopted' the old TLS certificates by
'describing' one of these newly created certificates:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ kubectl describe certificate my-example-certificate
   ...
   Events:
     Type    Reason            Age                 From                     Message
     ----    ------            ----                ----                     -------
     Normal  RenewalScheduled  1m                  cert-manager-controller  Certificate scheduled for renewal in 292 hours

Here we can see cert-manager has verified the existing TLS certificate and
scheduled it to be renewed in 292h time.
