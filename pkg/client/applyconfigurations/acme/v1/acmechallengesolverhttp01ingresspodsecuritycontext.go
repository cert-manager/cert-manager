	// The SELinux context to be applied to all containers.
	// If unspecified, the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each
	// container.  May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in
	// both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext
	// takes precedence for that container.
	// Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
	SELinuxOptions *corev1.SELinuxOptions `json:"seLinuxOptions,omitempty"`
	// The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process.
	// Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified.
	// May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
	// PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence
	// for that container.
	// Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
	RunAsUser *int64 `json:"runAsUser,omitempty"`
	// The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process.
	// Uses runtime default if unset.
	// May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
	// PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence
	// for that container.
	// Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
	RunAsGroup *int64 `json:"runAsGroup,omitempty"`
	// Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user.
	// If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it
	// does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does.
	// If unset or false, no such validation will be performed.
	// May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and
	// PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
	RunAsNonRoot *bool `json:"runAsNonRoot,omitempty"`
	// A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in addition
	// to the container's primary GID, the fsGroup (if specified), and group memberships
	// defined in the container image for the uid of the container process. If unspecified,
	// no additional groups are added to any container. Note that group memberships
	// defined in the container image for the uid of the container process are still effective,
	// even if they are not included in this list.
	// Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
	SupplementalGroups []int64 `json:"supplementalGroups,omitempty"`
	// A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod.
	// Some volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume
	// to be owned by the pod:
	//
	// 1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup
	// 2. The setgid bit is set (new files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup)
	// 3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----
	//
	// If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume.
	// Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
	FSGroup *int64 `json:"fsGroup,omitempty"`
	// Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with unsupported
	// sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch.
	// Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
	Sysctls []corev1.Sysctl `json:"sysctls,omitempty"`
	// fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of the volume
	// before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to
	// volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions).
	// It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps
	// and emptydir.
	// Valid values are "OnRootMismatch" and "Always". If not specified, "Always" is used.
	// Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
	FSGroupChangePolicy *corev1.PodFSGroupChangePolicy `json:"fsGroupChangePolicy,omitempty"`
	// The seccomp options to use by the containers in this pod.
	// Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows.
