# Legacy Development Tooling

These scripts are no longer maintained and shouldn't be used.

If you want to build or develop cert-manager, use the documentation on [cert-manager.io](https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/building/).

Those docs will walk through using make to develop cert-manager, which is the only officially tested and supported way.
