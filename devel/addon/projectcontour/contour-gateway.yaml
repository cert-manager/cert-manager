                    not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    \n Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one
                    in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition:
                    when it is `status: true` there are no problems. \n In more detail,
                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour.  The details of the errors will be present under
                    the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either
                    the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in

                    \n Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one

                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour.  The details of the errors will be present under

                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either

                    conditions, with two extra fields to hold sub-conditions, which
                    provide more detailed reasons for the state (True or False) of
                    the condition. \n `errors` holds information about sub-conditions
                    which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                    \n `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are
                    not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    \n Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one
                    in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition:
                    when it is `status: true` there are no problems. \n In more detail,
                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour.  The details of the errors will be present under
                    the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either
                    the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in
                    total across both the `errors` and `warnings` slices), or `MultipleReasons`

                    \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one
                    in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition:
                    when it is `status: true` there are no problems. \n In more detail,
                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour.  The details of the errors will be present under
                    the `errors` field. There must be at least one error in the `errors`
                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either
                    the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in

                    the condition. \n `errors` holds information about sub-conditions
                    which are fatal to that condition and render its state False.
                    \n `warnings` holds information about sub-conditions which are
                    not fatal to that condition and do not force the state to be False.
                    \n Remember that Conditions have a type, a status, and a reason.
                    \n The type is the type of the condition, the most important one
                    in this CRD set is `Valid`. `Valid` is a positive-polarity condition:
                    when it is `status: true` there are no problems. \n In more detail,
                    `status: true` means that the object is has been ingested into
                    Contour with no errors. `warnings` may still be present, and will
                    be indicated in the Reason field. There must be zero entries in
                    the `errors` slice in this case. \n `Valid`, `status: false` means
                    that the object has had one or more fatal errors during processing
                    into Contour.  The details of the errors will be present under

                    slice if `status` is `false`. \n For DetailedConditions of types
                    other than `Valid`, the Condition must be in the negative polarity.
                    When they have `status` `true`, there is an error. There must
                    be at least one entry in the `errors` Subcondition slice. When
                    they have `status` `false`, there are no serious errors, and there
                    must be zero entries in the `errors` slice. In either case, there
                    may be entries in the `warnings` slice. \n Regardless of the polarity,
                    the `reason` and `message` fields must be updated with either
                    the detail of the reason (if there is one and only one entry in

          be used as a template for Gateways. This means that a Gateway is based on
          the state of the GatewayClass at the time it was created and changes to
          the GatewayClass or associated parameters are not propagated down to existing
          Gateways. This recommendation is intended to limit the blast radius of changes
          to GatewayClass or associated parameters. If implementations choose to propagate
          GatewayClass changes to existing Gateways, that MUST be clearly documented
          by the implementation. \n Whenever one or more Gateways are using a GatewayClass,
          implementations MUST add the `gateway-exists-finalizer.gateway.networking.k8s.io`
          finalizer on the associated GatewayClass. This ensures that a GatewayClass

                  each group of Listeners into a single Listener if the implementation
                  determines that the Listeners in the group are \"compatible\". An
                  implementation MAY also group together and collapse compatible Listeners
                  belonging to different Gateways. \n For example, an implementation
                  might consider Listeners to be compatible with each other if all
                  of the following conditions are met: \n 1. Either each Listener
                  within the group specifies the \"HTTP\"    Protocol or each Listener
                  within the group specifies either    the \"HTTPS\" or \"TLS\" Protocol.
                  \n 2. Each Listener within the group specifies a Hostname that is
                  unique    within the group. \n 3. As a special case, one Listener
                  within a group may omit Hostname,    in which case this Listener
                  matches when no other Listener    matches. \n If the implementation
                  does collapse compatible Listeners, the hostname provided in the
                  incoming client request MUST be matched to a Listener to find the
                  correct set of Routes. The incoming hostname MUST be matched using
                  the Hostname field for each Listener in order of most to least specific.
                  That is, exact matches must be processed before wildcard matches.
                  \n If this field specifies multiple Listeners that have the same
                  Port value but are not compatible, the implementation must raise
                  a \"Conflicted\" condition in the Listener status. \n Support: Core"

                                    defined by   \"Support: Core\" in this package,
                                    e.g. \"RequestHeaderModifier\". All   implementations
                                    must support core filters. \n - Extended: Filter
                                    types and their corresponding configuration defined
                                    by   \"Support: Extended\" in this package, e.g.
                                    \"RequestMirror\". Implementers   are encouraged
                                    to support extended filters. \n - Custom: Filters
                                    that are defined and supported by specific vendors.
                                    \  In the future, filters showing convergence
                                    in behavior across multiple   implementations
                                    will be considered for inclusion in extended or
                                    core   conformance levels. Filter-specific configuration
                                    for such filters   is specified using the ExtensionRef
                                    field. `Type` should be set to   \"ExtensionRef\"
                                    for custom filters. \n Implementers are encouraged
                                    to define custom implementation types to extend
                                    the core API with implementation-specific behavior.
                                    \n If a reference to a custom filter type cannot
                                    be resolved, the filter MUST NOT be skipped. Instead,
