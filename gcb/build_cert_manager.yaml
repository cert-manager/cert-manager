# This cloudbuild config file is intended to be triggered when a tag is pushed to the cert-manager repo
# and will build a cert-manager release and push to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

# The release won't be published automatically; this file just defines the build steps.

# The full release and publish process is documented here:
# https://cert-manager.io/docs/contributing/release-process/

timeout: 2700s # 45m

steps:
# cert-manager relies on the git checkout to determine release version, among other things
# By default, gcb only does a shallow clone, so we need to "unshallow" to get more details
